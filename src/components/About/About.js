We believe in creating interesting and unique places to enjoy our simple and great tasting “Real Bangladeshi” food. Sometimes we pop up in shopping centres, sometimes in a great shopping strip. Either way we'll make sure you feel like you're in our home and ready for some of our great, simple food.
